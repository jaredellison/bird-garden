### Inspiration

[Hans Mikelson's article in CSound Magazine Winter 2000:  "Real-time: Bird Calls"](https://web.archive.org/web/20120531040558/http://www.csounds.com/ezine/winter2000/realtime/index.html)

[Andy Farnell's Designing Sound](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sound)

### Usage

```bash
# Clone repo and change into the new directory
git clone https://github.com/jaredellison/bird-garden && cd bird-garden

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

User interaction is required to start audio playback - turn up the volume, adjust the frequency and start playing.
